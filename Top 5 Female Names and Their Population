## Explanation:

This SQL code fetches the top 5 most common female names from a dataset, along with their total occurrences.

1. SELECT clause:
   - Retrieves two columns:
     - Trimmed names (with leading/trailing spaces removed) as 'Names'.
     - Total occurrence count as 'Total_number' or their population.

2. FROM clause:
   - Specifies the data source: 'bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current'.

3. WHERE clause:
   - Filters for females by 'gender = "F"'.

4. GROUP BY clause:
   - Groups data by 'Names' to combine identical names.

5. ORDER BY clause:
   - Sorts results by 'Total_number' in descending order.

6. Limit 5:
   - Displays only the top 5 results.
