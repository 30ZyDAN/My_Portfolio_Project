## Explanation:

WITH top_five_girl_name AS (
    SELECT
        DISTINCT TRIM(name) AS Names,
        SUM(number) AS Total_number
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
    WHERE 
        gender = "F"
    GROUP BY
        Names
    ORDER by Total_number DESC
    Limit 5
)

This CTE is named top_five_girl_name and serves as a temporary result set that is used within the subsequent main query.
It selects unique (DISTINCT) female names (Names) from the usa_1910_current table, trims any leading or trailing spaces from the names, and calculates the total number of occurrences (Total_number) of each name.
The WHERE clause filters the data to only include names with a gender value of "F," which indicates female names.
The GROUP BY clause groups the names so that each unique name appears only once in the result set.
The ORDER BY clause sorts the result by the total number of occurrences (Total_number) in descending order.
The LIMIT 5 clause restricts the result to the top five names with the highest total occurrences among females.

## Explanation:

The main query builds upon the CTE top_five_girl_name to further analyze the data, focusing on the top five female names and their popularity by state.
It selects the columns name, state, and the calculated Total_number (the sum of occurrences) from two sources:
The CTE top_five_girl_name (aliased as five_name_of_girls), which contains the top five female names and their total occurrences.
The usa_1910_current table (aliased as current_names), which contains detailed information about names by state, year, and gender.
The INNER JOIN clause links the CTE and the table on the common column Names, which represents the female names.
The WHERE clause further filters the data to only include names with a gender value of "F," ensuring that only female names are included.
The GROUP BY clause groups the data by name and state, aggregating the total occurrences for each name in each state.
Finally, the ORDER BY clause sorts the result by the total number of occurrences (Total_number) in descending order, showing the most popular female names by state.

In summary, this SQL code identifies the top five female names, their total occurrences, and their popularity by state, providing insights into the geographic distribution of these names.
